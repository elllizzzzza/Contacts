# Contacts
A command-line contact management application built in Java, demonstrating core OOP principles. It supports storing, editing, searching, and persisting contact records for both people and organizations, with a clean menu-driven interface.

üîç Description

Contacts is a multi-stage project designed to teach and practice Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java.
